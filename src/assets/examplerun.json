None of the requirements apply at this stage, with the first prohibitions on certain AI systems starting on February 2, 2025[1]. On August 2, 2025, additional rules come into force, including those related to notified bodies[2], General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence (“GPAI”) models[3], governance[4], confidentiality[5], and penalties[6]. By August 2, 2026, most of the remaining provisions will apply, except for Article 6(1), which will come into effect on August 2, 2027, along with its corresponding obligations[7].",

This regulatory framework imposes additional obligations on providers and deployers of AI systems, intended to complement rather than replace existing legislation. This bulletin provides an overview to help users and service providers understand how new regulations like the EU AI Act interact with existing laws, such as the GDPR (\"General Data Protection Regulation\").",

In healthcare, high-risk AI will be that which is used for purposes such as diagnosis, monitoring physiological processes, and treatment decision-making, amongst others. Most of these uses are also software classed as a Medical Device requiring ‘conformity’ assessment by a regulator. The AI Act uses this classification: all AI used in software requiring this Medical Device conformity assessment are classified in the Act as high-risk AI.",

The European Union (EU) has been at the forefront of developing sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) and data governance frameworks, driven by a commitment to data protection, digital rights, fundamental values and ethical standards. This chapter examines the evolving EU AI-related regulations and their potential implications for healthcare, highlighting key instruments including the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), the AI Liability Directive (AILD) and the revised Product Liability Directive (revised PLD), and their intersection with AI medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and generative AI (GenAI).",

Section 4 explores the European data architecture that intersects with the laws in this area, particularly highlighting the GDPR’s intersection with the AI Act, and further examines the sector-specific European Health Data Space (EHDS) Regulation. Overall, one of the striking limitations of EU governance is that it does not contemplate health specifically. Although regulations set out detailed compliance protocols for AI systems generally, systematic research is required to adequately assess the implications of the governance architecture for AI in health.",

The European Union (EU) is tackling these issues with the existing legal framework and drafting new regulations, such as the proposed AI Act. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) partly regulates AI systems, with rules on processing personal data and protecting data subjects against solely automated decision-making.",

We then introduce and clarify the proposed AI Act regarding healthcare services and medical research. Finally, the article concludes with a novel elaboration on the connection between the principles of data protection and ethical AI. Traditionally, health data are collected and processed for specific purposes, such as diagnosis and direct care.",
                                        "However, the application of AI systems requires a more specific, novel regulation, which the EU aims for with the proposed AI Act. As the GDPR only partly covers the regulation of AI systems, mainly through processing personal data and protecting of data subjects against ADM, it does not provide comprehensive protection against AI systems. The regulation of these systems requires a more complex legal landscape with strict enforcement, especially in healthcare services and medical research.",

(4) Transparency: Transparency is one of the data-processing principles in GDPR,41 which prevails through several rights, such as the right to access and be informed.42 In the proposed AI Act, transparency is required for specific AI systems, such as high-risk ones. In healthcare services and medical research, decisions need to be transparent and explainable for safety and trust."

The European Union (EU) is tackling these issues with the existing legal framework and drafting new regulations, such as the proposed AI Act. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) partly regulates AI systems, with rules on processing personal data and protecting data subjects against solely automated decision-making.",

However, medical research focuses on innovation and efficacy, with less direct decisions on individuals. Therefore, the GDPR’s restrictions on solely automated decision-making apply mainly to healthcare services, and the rights of patients and research participants may significantly differ.",

Some conclusions we have already drawn in the section about fundamental laws (e.g. human oversight as a key criterion) are further strengthened and expanded through this more detailed overview.

As the principle of “informed consent” is (also outside the scope of data protection law) one of the pillars of medical law not only in EU law, but also in the law of EU Member States, there is only one further exception to the requirement of “informed consent” which is, however, to be interpreted narrowly: Automated processing of health data may take place in the reasons of substantial public interest, e.g.",

If “explanation” is defined as “information about basic system functionality” (see the following paragraph), the answer is in the affirmative, if explanation is interpreted broadly in the sense of “explain the causes/internal processes which lead to an individual decision”, the answer is in the negative. As long as either the European Court of Justice does not clarify and expand the “right to an explanation” (e.g. the “right to be forgotten” was also created primarily through interpretation by the court [26]) or the GDPR is amended, it seems to only be a recommendation (and, as stated above, mere decision-support systems do not fall under the scope of such a right)."

While this article focuses on the EU context, its considerations are useful outside of the EU, as generally patients’ rights are derived from similar international human rights and medical–ethical standards.",

All EU Member States have long had their own laws and policies on health data protection in place based on the principle of medical confidentiality.51 At the same time, the harmonized nature of the GDPR may be of added value to smoothen the ‘patchwork’ of patients’ rights in the Member States, often consisting of legal instruments, ethical codes, and professional protocols."

To address these concerns, it has long been clear to national and European legislators that it was necessary to establish regulations and policies that protect the privacy of collected data and its use through AI, either on the basis of existing data protection laws, such as the GDPR in Europe, which already provide a framework to guarantee privacy and ensure that data is used responsibly, or through the enactment of a more general and cross-sectoral regulation that can protect the design, implementation and use of AI systems."
